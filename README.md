### Using 2d canvas in HTML as the canvas 

### Using JavaScript to create a star on the screen that goes in a random direction from the center of the canvas then bounces off the boarder of the canvas while creates "dust" that trails the star. The dust cycles through the color hue to create an amazing color effect. The dust shrink as they get created and also draws a line between other dust particles that dissapear as the particle dissapears.
